# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning
In this notebook we are going to predict the quality of wine using the feature like acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar.
            The dataset we are going to use is the wine quality dataset from Kaggle which contains about 1599 rows and 12 features.
              The dataset contains the labels which we have t predict and the labels are discrete and binary . So the problem we have is a Supervised Classification type.
